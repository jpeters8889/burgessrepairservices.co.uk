        ATA Accreditation
    </h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">ATA Success at Burgess Repair Services 13th June 2006</h3>

    <p class="mb-2">
        Father and son, John and Andrew Burgess, have both recently gained endorsements for the Automotive Technician
        Accreditation (ATA) through local training provider Total People. The ATA is a voluntary assessment programme
        within the motor industry aimed at raising standards for technicians. To gain accreditation, technicians must
        pass a series of assessments, both practical and knowledge based, with testing taking place at Total People's
        fully equipped Motor Vehicle workshop at their training centre in Telford.

        Both John and Andrew scored 100%, the first father and son pairing to do so.
    </p>

        Andrew had completed his Advanced Apprenticeship, again with Total People, during the summer of 2005 and felt
        that gaining the ATA was a natural progression for his development. "I'm a great believer in qualifications. The
        ATA is not only an excellent way to test a technicians skill but it also gives the customer greater confidence
        when it comes to choosing the right garage", says John.
